- /data
This is the folder that contains all simulated data used in our report
- /plots
In this folder all plots for the assignments are stated

- SA.py and SA_knn.py
These files can be experimented with if one wants to sample from its K-nearest-neighbor. However, for the assignments, we did not ended up using these files and therefore they can be neglected.
