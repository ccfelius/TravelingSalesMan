<b>* /data</b><br>
This is the folder that contains all simulated data used in our report<br><br>
<b>* /plots</b><br>
In this folder all plots for the assignments are stated<br><br>

<b>* SA.py and SA_knn.py</b><br>
These files can be experimented with if one wants to sample from its K-nearest-neighbor. However, for the assignments, we did not ended up using these files and therefore they can be neglected. <br><br>
